# Russia-Ukraine War
Data is pulled from this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bngHbR0YPS7XH1oSA1VxoL4R34z60SJcR3NxguZM9GI/edit#gid=0), which sources data from [Oryx's website](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html). Equipment losses listed in the Oryx database are independently verified via photographic evidence; this fact causes the following data to underreport equipment losses. Further, it makes sense that the Ukrainian statistics are under reported to a higher degree due to inherent bias and less reporting in Russian controlled areas. No adjustments are made to account for this. I have made a work in progress [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam44011739/viz/Ukraine_War_Equipment/Dashboard2?publish=yes) pulling data from a static csv to play around with the data.

Perhaps the higher share of Ukrainian loss of IMVs points to their usage of asymmetric warfare, with small groups of soldiers armed with anti-tank capabilities.
